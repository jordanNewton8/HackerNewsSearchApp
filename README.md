This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

# Comments from the Developer

## Hello! 

I'm Jordan, and I'm just trying to find my way in this wild west of web development. Funny how you can disappear into a company for a few years and when you come back out, everyone is using libraries and software and frameworks that really just seem like made-up words? This little test is (hopefully) the evidence of the effort I've made playing catch-up, as well as a spot of learning on the fly.

## My (Prior) Experience

My prior experience with the technologies in this project is...

- Vanilla JS: About 5 years on and off with vanilla javascript, and using various frameworks to meet my needs like Phaser.io (I was a game design major, before CS), or libraries like jQuery (because who hasn't ripped a totally free to use jQuery slider to use on their highschool club's website?). I've also used JS in tons of little projects or tasks across ServiceNow and Mendix and other personal projects- like the module I'm writing for FoundryVTT.
- CSS/SASS: Old hat. I've been ~~cheating at~~ writing 'creative' solutions for styles since middle school.
- React: Only picked up within the last year, writing individual widgets for Mendix. Currently using it for a personal project.
- Redux: ZILCH. This is where you'll be able to measure my ability to learn as I go. And sigh at some of the mixed and matched design approaches and techniques.
- HTML: Doesn't even need to be said. Same as CSS.
- Material UI: Why did I pick Material? Honest answer: I'm pretty tired of using Bootstrap. I felt it was time to learn something new.

## The Tools Used

My IDE of choice for this was Visual Studio Code, and my command prompt is Cmder.

To get around CORS issues I used local-cors-proxy, as this was just local development. 

Obviously, plenty of googling was involved for a great deal of Redux work in this project.

## My Thoughts and Design Approach

Throughout the various files of this project, you'll find comments around components and functions detailing my thoughts regarding how I did something or why I took a certain approach to it. You'll also see comments on how I would maybe attempt it a different way, or if I have any doubts about what I did was the correct approach.

## Happy Reading!

I try to take a standardized approach to writing my own code, and providing enough (but not too many) comments where necessary. This project will have additional comments so as to better elucidate you on my development and learning style, but I promise they won't be too egregious. Reading someone else's code is never a truly pleasant experience, so I hope you happy and painless reading!



# Boiler plate from create-react-app + npm

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
